## JavaScript - Algorand (BlockChain Development)

This repository provides an example project for using the Algorand blockchain with JavaScript. In order to get started, you will need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your system.

```
$ npm -v
```

If NPM is not installed, you can download and install it from the official website: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

Once NPM is installed, you can create a new NPM project by running the following command in your terminal:

Usage
Once you have installed the necessary packages, you can start using the Algorand SDK in your JavaScript code. You can require the SDK in your code as follows:

const algosdk = require('algosdk');
```

You can then use the various functions provided by the SDK to interact with the Algorand blockchain.
